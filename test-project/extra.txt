We grabbed the following from the data set:
- Movie title
- Movie release year
- Movie length (total minutes)
- Top 3 cast member names (actor names)
- We could not get access to the URL's of the images, so we searched for the movie posters on google. *NOTE* That the posters are not directly
    pulled from the data set, but rather as a reference when searching on google
